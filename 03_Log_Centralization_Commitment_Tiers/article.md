# Log Centralization, Commitment Tiers & Dedicated Clusters

## Introduction

Welcome to Part 3 of our comprehensive 5-part Azure Log Analytics cost optimization series. After covering unused tables ([Part 1](../01_Detect_Unused_Tables/)) and table plan optimization ([Part 2](../02_Log_Classifications/)), we now focus on **architectural cost optimization strategies** that can deliver enterprise-scale savings of 15-36% through log centralization, commitment tiers, and dedicated clusters.

### What You'll Learn in This Part

This guide covers Azure Monitor commitment tier pricing and how to implement dedicated clusters for aggregating workspace data to unlock volume discounts. You'll learn when these strategies make financial sense and how to implement them effectively.

*This is Part 3 of our 5-part series covering: Part 1 - Unused Tables, Part 2 - Table Plans, **Part 3 - Centralization & Commitment Tiers** (this article), Part 4 - Data Ingestion Control, and Part 5 - Advanced Optimization Strategies.*

## Azure Monitor Pricing & Commitment Tiers

### Understanding Azure Monitor Pricing Models

Azure Monitor Logs offers multiple pricing models designed to accommodate different usage patterns and provide cost optimization opportunities:

**Pay-As-You-Go (Default)**
- **Pricing**: $2.30/GB for Analytics tables
- **Best For**: Variable or unpredictable data volumes
- **Billing**: Monthly based on actual data ingested
- **Flexibility**: No commitment, scale up or down anytime

**Commitment Tiers (Volume Discounts)**
- **Pricing**: Discounted rates starting at 100GB/day commitment
- **Best For**: Predictable, consistent data ingestion patterns
- **Billing**: Fixed daily commitment regardless of actual usage
- **Savings**: 15-30% discount depending on commitment level

### Available Commitment Tiers

Azure Monitor Logs offers multiple commitment tiers starting at 100GB/day with savings ranging from 15% to 30%+ depending on volume. The most common tiers include 100 GB/day (~15% savings, ~$6,000/month) and 200 GB/day (~20% savings, ~$11,000/month), with higher enterprise tiers available offering up to 36% savings.

These are daily commitments where you pay the full amount regardless of actual usage, with a 30-day minimum commitment and the ability to change tiers monthly. Overage charges apply at standard rates when exceeding your commitment level.

**Not reaching commitment tiers on individual workspaces?** Dedicated clusters allow you to aggregate data ingestion across multiple workspaces to collectively reach commitment tier thresholds, unlocking volume discounts that wouldn't be available to individual smaller workspaces.

## Dedicated Clusters: What, Why, and How

### What Are Dedicated Clusters?

Azure Monitor Dedicated Clusters are isolated compute and storage environments that provide enhanced control, predictable performance, and significant cost savings for large-scale log analytics workloads.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Minimum commitment**: 100 GB/day (though CLI minimum is currently 500 GB/day, use REST to configure lower commitment tiers with minimum of 100 GB.)
- **Isolated infrastructure**: Dedicated compute and storage resources
- **Regional scope**: Can link up to 1,000 workspaces in the same region
- **31-day commitment period**: Can increase tier anytime, but must wait 31 days to decrease

> **⚠️ Important Regional Requirement**: Log Analytics workspaces must be deployed in the same region as the dedicated cluster. Cross-region linking is not supported.

### Why Choose Dedicated Clusters?

**Primary Focus: Cost Optimization Benefits**:
- **Volume discounts**: Commitment tier pricing starting at 100 GB/day
- **Predictable costs**: Fixed daily commitment simplifies budgeting and planning
- **Consolidated billing**: Link workspaces across different subscriptions to one cluster
- **Flexible billing attribution**: Choose between cluster-level or workspace-proportional billing

**Key Cost Advantage via Data Aggregation**: The most compelling cost benefit of dedicated clusters is the ability to combine data ingestion across multiple workspaces to reach commitment tier thresholds. This is ideal for scenarios where individual workspaces might only ingest 20-50 GB/day, but collectively across 5-10 workspaces, you reach the 100+ GB/day minimum for significant volume discounts.

For comprehensive information about dedicated clusters, including capabilities, detailed implementation guides and advanced configuration options, see the [official Azure Monitor dedicated clusters documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters). 

### How to Implement Dedicated Clusters

**Planning Phase**: First, assess your combined workspace ingestion across regions to ensure you meet the 100+ GB/day minimum. Calculate the ROI by comparing cluster commitment tier costs against your current pay-as-you-go expenses to validate the business case.

**Deployment**: Azure Monitor dedicated clusters can be deployed using multiple tools including the Azure portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, ARM/Bicep templates, or REST API. The process involves creating the cluster with your chosen commitment tier, then linking your existing workspaces to begin cost optimization.

**Key Notes**: Cluster provisioning takes approximately 2 hours, workspace linking up to 90 minutes, and billing starts immediately upon cluster creation. Historical data remains in original workspace locations—only new data uses the cluster infrastructure.

For comprehensive step-by-step implementation guides covering all deployment methods (portal, CLI, PowerShell, templates), detailed configuration options, and troubleshooting, see the [Azure Monitor dedicated clusters documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters?tabs=azure-portal).

### Best Practices

**Capacity Planning**:
- **Start conservative**: Begin with minimum viable commitment tier (100GB/day)
- **Monitor utilization**: Track daily ingestion vs commitment to optimize tier selection
- **Plan for growth**: Consider future data ingestion trends and business expansion
- **Overage management**: Monitor overage charges when exceeding daily commitment

**Workspace Organization for Cost Optimization**:
- **Regional consolidation**: Link workspaces within the same region to maximize cluster benefits and avoid cross-region charges
- **Aggregate smaller workspaces**: Combine workspaces with lower individual ingestion to reach commitment tier thresholds

For additional best practices including security, compliance, and operational considerations, see the [Azure Monitor dedicated clusters documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters).

### When to Consider Dedicated Clusters

**Cost-Driven Ideal Scenarios**:
- **Large enterprises** with consistent 100+ GB/day ingestion (500+ GB for significant benefits)
- **Multi-subscription environments** where aggregating workspaces enables commitment tier savings
- **Distributed workspaces** with combined ingestion meeting minimum thresholds

**Cost Break-Even Analysis**:
Dedicated clusters become cost-effective when:
- **Combined workspace ingestion** consistently meets or exceeds commitment tier
- **Volume discounts** offset the fixed daily commitment costs
- **Predictable workloads** justify commitment tier pricing over pay-as-you-go

**When NOT to Use Dedicated Clusters**:
- **Small environments** with <100 GB/day consistent ingestion
- **Highly variable workloads** with unpredictable data patterns that may not meet daily commitments
- **Single workspace environments** without the need for data aggregation benefits

For additional scenarios including compliance, performance, and operational considerations, see the [Azure Monitor dedicated clusters documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters).

### Pricing Model Details

**Commitment Tier Structure**:
- **Daily commitment**: Fixed cost regardless of actual daily ingestion
- **Overage charges**: Standard per-GB rates apply when exceeding commitment
- **Tier flexibility**: Can increase tier anytime; 31-day wait to decrease
- **Billing attribution options**:
  - **Cluster billing** (default): All costs attributed to cluster resource
  - **Workspace billing**: Costs distributed proportionally across linked workspaces
