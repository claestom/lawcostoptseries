# Azure Log Analytics Cost Optimization

This repository is the home of a **5-part series** focused on helping you analyze and optimize the cost and usage of your Azure Log Analytics workspaces. Each part of the series will address a key aspect of cost optimization, from identifying unused tables to advanced architectural design.

## Series Overview

This series will consist of 5 parts:

1. **Detect Unused Tables, Basic/Analytic/Auxiliary Logs**  
   Learn how to identify tables that are ingesting data but are rarely or never queried, and understand the different log types in Log Analytics.
2. **Log Centralization, Commitment Tiers, Dedicated Clusters**  
   Explore strategies for centralizing logs, leveraging commitment tiers, and using dedicated clusters for cost efficiency.
3. **Controlling Data Ingestion**  
   Techniques and tools to control and reduce unnecessary data ingestion into your workspaces.
4. **Design, Architecture & Best Practices**  
   Guidance on designing scalable, cost-effective, and secure Log Analytics environments.
5. **Other Advanced Topics**  
   Additional tips, tricks, and advanced scenarios for optimizing your Azure Monitor and Log Analytics usage.
