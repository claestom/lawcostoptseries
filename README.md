# Azure Log Analytics Cost Optimization

This repository is the home of a **5-part series** focused on helping you analyze and optimize the cost and usage of your Azure Log Analytics workspaces. Each part of the series will address a key aspect of cost optimization, from identifying unused tables to advanced architectural design.

## Series Overview

This series will consist of 5 parts:

1. **Detect Unused Tables**  
   Learn how to identify tables that are ingesting data but are rarely or never queried, and understand the different log types in Log Analytics.
2. **Optimize the logs: Analytic vs Basic vs Auxiliary**  
   Understand table plan classifications and optimize costs by choosing the right plan for each data type.
3. **Log Centralization, Commitment Tiers & Dedicated Clusters**  
   Explore strategies for centralizing logs, leveraging commitment tiers, and using dedicated clusters for cost efficiency.
4. **Controlling Data Ingestion & Transformations**  
   Techniques and tools to control and reduce unnecessary data ingestion using data collection rules and KQL transformations.
5. **Design, Architecture & Best Practices**  
   Guidance on designing scalable, cost-effective, and secure Log Analytics environments.
