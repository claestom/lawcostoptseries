# Cost Optimization for Azure Log Analytics Workspaces: Part 1 of a 5-Part Series – A Practical Guide

*This article is Part 1 of a 5-part series on how to optimize Log Analytics workspace cost in Azure.*

Azure Log Analytics is a powerful platform for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. However, as your data grows, so can your costs. This article provides a practical approach to understanding and optimizing the cost and usage of your Log Analytics workspaces, using a set of open-source queries and an Azure Workbook solution.

## Why Cost Optimization Matters

Log Analytics charges primarily for data ingestion and retention. Unused or rarely queried data can quickly inflate your Azure Monitor bill. By identifying which tables are actively used and monitoring ingestion trends, you can make informed decisions to reduce unnecessary costs without sacrificing operational insight.

## How the Solution Works

The solution leverages Azure Monitor Workbooks and Kusto Query Language (KQL) to provide actionable insights into your Log Analytics workspaces. Here’s how it helps you optimize costs:

### 1. Workspace Inventory

The workbook lists all Log Analytics workspaces in your selected subscriptions, showing their name, location, resource group, and subscription. This provides a clear overview of your monitoring estate.

### 2. Data Ingestion Trends

Track the daily volume of billable data (in GB) ingested into each workspace. This helps you spot spikes, anomalies, or steady growth that could impact your costs.

**Sample Query:**
```kusto
Usage
| where IsBillable
| summarize DataGB = sum(Quantity / 1000) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

---

### 3. Table Usage Analysis

Identify which tables are being queried and how often. The workbook highlights tables that are ingesting data but are rarely or never accessed, making them candidates for optimization.

**Sample Query:**
```kusto
let TimeRange = 7d;
let TablesWithData = 
    union withsource = Tables *
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(TimeRange)
    | distinct Tables;
let QueriedTables = 
    LAQueryLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(TimeRange)
    | extend SourceTable = extract(@"(\w+)\s*(\||$)", 1, QueryText)
    | summarize Count = count() by SourceTable;
TablesWithData
| join kind=fullouter (QueriedTables) on $left.Tables == $right.SourceTable
| extend TableName = coalesce(Tables, SourceTable)
| extend TableCount = coalesce(Count, 0)
| where isnotempty(TableName) and TableName !in ("table", "Tables", "Operation")
| project TableName, TableCount
| sort by TableCount desc
```

---

### 4. Troubleshooting Query Activity

To investigate who or what is querying specific tables, use the following KQL:

```kusto
let TimeRange = 1d;
LAQueryLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(TimeRange)
| extend SourceTable = extract(@"(\w+)\s*(\||$)", 1, QueryText)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceTable, RequestClientApp, CorrelationId
```

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   The full solution, including all KQL queries and the Azure Workbook template, is available on GitHub:  
   [Azure Log Analytics Cost Optimization (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo)

2. **Deploy the Workbook**  
   Follow the instructions in the repository to import the workbook into your Azure environment and start analyzing your workspaces.

3. **Customize and Scale**  
   The solution is designed to be extensible. You can adapt the queries and workbook to your organization’s needs, and the repository provides guidance for deploying at scale.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review workspace and table usage.
- Remove or archive unused tables and data sources.
- Set up alerts for unusual ingestion spikes.
- Use Azure Cost Management in conjunction with these insights for proactive cost control.
